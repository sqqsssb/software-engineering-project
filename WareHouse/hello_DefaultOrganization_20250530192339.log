To address the customer's task of saying hi in Python, we should consider the most suitable product modality that can effectively present this simple code execution. 

Given the nature of the task, which is straightforward and primarily focused on coding, I suggest we consider the following modalities:

1. **Document**: We could create a .docx file that explains the task and includes the Python code.
2. **Application**: We could develop a simple application that runs the Python code and displays the output.
3. **Website**: We could create a simple HTML page that includes the code and allows users to execute it in a browser environment.

What are your thoughts on these options?
