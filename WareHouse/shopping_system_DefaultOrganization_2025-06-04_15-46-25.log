To determine the best product modality for the online shopping system, we should consider the nature of the project. An online shopping system typically requires interactive elements, user engagement, and the ability to handle transactions securely. 

1. **Website**: This modality is essential for an online shopping system as it allows users to browse products, add items to their cart, and complete purchases. It can also be designed to be responsive for mobile users.

2. **Application**: If we want to provide a more immersive experience, a dedicated application could be beneficial. This could include features like push notifications for sales or new products.

3. **Dashboard**: A dashboard could be useful for the admin side of the online shopping system, allowing for real-time monitoring of sales, inventory, and user engagement.

Considering these options, I believe a **Website** would be the most suitable modality for the online shopping system, as it directly addresses the core functionality required by users. What are your thoughts?

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.

Chief Executive Officer: ChatDev has made products in the following form before:
Image: can present information in line chart, bar chart, flow chart, cloud chart, Gantt chart, etc.
Document: can present information via .docx files.
PowerPoint: can present information via .pptx files.
Excel: can present information via .xlsx files.
PDF: can present information via .pdf files.
Website: can present personal resume, tutorial, products, or ideas, via .html files.
Application: can implement visualized game, software, tool, etc, via python.
Dashboard: can display a panel visualizing real-time information.
Mind Map: can represent ideas, with related concepts arranged around a core concept.
As the Chief Product Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and the product should be realizable, you should keep discussing with me to decide which product modality do we want the product to be?
Note that we must ONLY discuss the product modality and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion by replying with only one line, which starts with a single word <INFO>, followed by our final product modality without any other words, e.g., "<INFO> PowerPoint".

Chief Product Officer: To determine the best product modality for the online shopping system, we should consider the nature of the project. An online shopping system typically requires interactive elements, user engagement, and the ability to handle transactions securely. 
1. **Website**: This modality is essential for an online shopping system as it allows users to browse products, add items to their cart, and complete purchases. It can also be designed to be responsive for mobile users.
2. **Application**: If we want to provide a more immersive experience, a dedicated application could be beneficial. This could include features like push notifications for sales or new products.
3. **Dashboard**: A dashboard could be useful for the admin side of the online shopping system, allowing for real-time monitoring of sales, inventory, and user engagement.
Considering these options, I believe a **Website** would be the most suitable modality for the online shopping system, as it directly addresses the core functionality required by users. What are your thoughts?

Answer their final product modality in the discussion without any other words, e.g., "PowerPoint"

To complete the task, you must write a response that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and customer's needs.]

According to the new user's task and our software designs listed below: 

Task: "开发一个在线购物系统".

Task description: "".

Modality: "website".

Programming Language: "  Python"

Ideas:""

We have decided to complete the task through a executable software with multiple files implemented via   Python. As the Programmer, to satisfy the new user's demands, you should write one or multiple files and make sure that every detail of the architecture is, in the end, implemented as code. The software should be equipped with graphical user interface (GUI) so that user can visually and graphically use it; so you must choose a GUI framework (e.g., in Python, you can implement GUI via tkinter, Pygame, Flexx, PyGUI, etc,).

Think step by step and reason yourself to the right decisions to make sure we get it right.

You will first lay out the names of the core classes, functions, methods that will be necessary, as well as a quick comment on their purpose.

Then you will output the content of each file including complete code. Each file must strictly follow a markdown code block format, where the following tokens must be replaced such that "FILENAME" is the lowercase file name including the file extension, "LANGUAGE" in the programming language, "DOCSTRING" is a string literal specified in source code that is used to document a specific segment of code, and "CODE" is the original code:

FILENAME

```LANGUAGE

'''

DOCSTRING

'''

CODE

```

You will start with the "main" file, then go to the ones that are imported by that file, and so on.

Please note that the code should be fully functional. Ensure to implement all functions. No placeholders (such as 'pass' in Python).

To develop an online shopping system using Python, we will structure our application with a clear separation of concerns. Below are the core classes, functions, and methods that will be necessary for our implementation:

### Core Classes and Functions

1. **User**: Represents a user of the shopping system.
   - `register()`: Method to register a new user.
   - `login()`: Method for user login.

2. **Product**: Represents a product in the shopping system.
   - `search()`: Method to search for products.
   - `browse()`: Method to display available products.

3. **ShoppingCart**: Represents a user's shopping cart.
   - `add_item()`: Method to add a product to the cart.
   - `remove_item()`: Method to remove a product from the cart.
   - `checkout()`: Method to process the order.

4. **Order**: Represents an order placed by a user.
   - `create_order()`: Method to create a new order.
   - `view_order()`: Method to view order details.

5. **Database**: Handles database operations.
   - `connect()`: Method to connect to the database.
   - `execute_query()`: Method to execute SQL queries.

6. **GUI**: Handles the graphical user interface.
   - `create_main_window()`: Method to create the main application window.
   - `create_user_interface()`: Method to create user interface components.

### File Structure

1. `main.py`: The main entry point of the application.
2. `user.py`: Contains the User class.
3. `product.py`: Contains the Product class.
4. `shopping_cart.py`: Contains the ShoppingCart class.
