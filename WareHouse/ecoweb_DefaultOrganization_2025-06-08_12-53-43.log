To determine the best product modality for the e-commerce financial website, we should consider the nature of the project. A website is essential for this task since it will serve as the primary platform for the e-commerce functionalities, user interactions, and financial services. 

However, we could also consider creating a dashboard for visualizing real-time financial data or analytics related to the e-commerce transactions. 

What are your thoughts on these options?

Dashboard: can display a panel visualizing real-time information.
Mind Map: can represent ideas, with related concepts arranged around a core concept.
As the Chief Product Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and the product should be realizable, you should keep discussing with me to decide which product modality do we want the product to be?
Note that we must ONLY discuss the product modality and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion by replying with only one line, which starts with a single word <INFO>, followed by our final product modality without any other words, e.g., "<INFO> PowerPoint".

Chief Product Officer: To determine the best product modality for the e-commerce financial website, we should consider the nature of the project. A website is essential for this task since it will serve as the primary platform for the e-commerce functionalities, user interactions, and financial services. 
However, we could also consider creating a dashboard for visualizing real-time financial data or analytics related to the e-commerce transactions. 
What are your thoughts on these options?

Answer their final product modality in the discussion without any other words, e.g., "PowerPoint"
