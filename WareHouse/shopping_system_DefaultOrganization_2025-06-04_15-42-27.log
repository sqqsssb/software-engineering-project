To determine the most suitable product modality for the online shopping system, we should consider the nature of the system and how users will interact with it. 

1. **Website**: This is the most straightforward option, as an online shopping system typically requires a web interface for users to browse products, add items to their cart, and complete purchases. It allows for dynamic content and user interaction.

2. **Application**: If we want to provide a more robust experience, especially for mobile users, developing a dedicated application could be beneficial. However, this may require more resources and time.

3. **Dashboard**: While a dashboard could be useful for internal analytics or admin purposes, it doesn't serve the primary function of the shopping system for end-users.

Given these considerations, I believe a **Website** would be the most effective modality for the online shopping system. What are your thoughts?
