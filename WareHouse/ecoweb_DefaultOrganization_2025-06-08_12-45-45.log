To address the customer's task of creating an e-commerce financial website, we need to consider the most suitable product modality. 

A website would be the most appropriate choice since it directly aligns with the customer's request for an e-commerce platform. It allows for interactive features, user accounts, payment processing, and can be designed to be mobile-responsive, which is crucial for e-commerce.

However, we could also consider a dashboard modality if the focus is on visualizing financial data in real-time, but it wouldn't encompass the full e-commerce functionality.

What are your thoughts on this?

Chief Executive Officer: ChatDev has made products in the following form before:
Image: can present information in line chart, bar chart, flow chart, cloud chart, Gantt chart, etc.
Document: can present information via .docx files.
PowerPoint: can present information via .pptx files.
Excel: can present information via .xlsx files.
PDF: can present information via .pdf files.
Website: can present personal resume, tutorial, products, or ideas, via .html files.
Application: can implement visualized game, software, tool, etc, via python.
Dashboard: can display a panel visualizing real-time information.
Mind Map: can represent ideas, with related concepts arranged around a core concept.
As the Chief Product Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and the product should be realizable, you should keep discussing with me to decide which product modality do we want the product to be?
Note that we must ONLY discuss the product modality and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion by replying with only one line, which starts with a single word <INFO>, followed by our final product modality without any other words, e.g., "<INFO> PowerPoint".

Chief Product Officer: To address the customer's task of creating an e-commerce financial website, we need to consider the most suitable product modality. 
A website would be the most appropriate choice since it directly aligns with the customer's request for an e-commerce platform. It allows for interactive features, user accounts, payment processing, and can be designed to be mobile-responsive, which is crucial for e-commerce.
However, we could also consider a dashboard modality if the focus is on visualizing financial data in real-time, but it wouldn't encompass the full e-commerce functionality.
What are your thoughts on this?

Answer their final product modality in the discussion without any other words, e.g., "PowerPoint"
