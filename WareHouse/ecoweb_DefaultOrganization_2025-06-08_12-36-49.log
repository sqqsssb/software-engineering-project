To determine the best product modality for the e-commerce financial website, we should consider the nature of the project. Given that the task involves creating a fully functional website with various features, I believe that the "Website" modality would be the most suitable option. It allows us to implement all necessary functionalities, such as payment gateways, user accounts, and content creation, while providing an interactive experience for users.

What are your thoughts on this?

As the Chief Product Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and the product should be realizable, you should keep discussing with me to decide which product modality do we want the product to be?
Note that we must ONLY discuss the product modality and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion by replying with only one line, which starts with a single word <INFO>, followed by our final product modality without any other words, e.g., "<INFO> PowerPoint".

Chief Product Officer: To determine the best product modality for the e-commerce financial website, we should consider the nature of the project. Given that the task involves creating a fully functional website with various features, I believe that the "Website" modality would be the most suitable option. It allows us to implement all necessary functionalities, such as payment gateways, user accounts, and content creation, while providing an interactive experience for users.
What are your thoughts on this?

Answer their final product modality in the discussion without any other words, e.g., "PowerPoint"

As the Chief Product Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and the product should be realizable, you should keep discussing with me to decide which product modality do we want the product to be?
Note that we must ONLY discuss the product modality and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion by replying with only one line, which starts with a single word <INFO>, followed by our final product modality without any other words, e.g., "<INFO> PowerPoint".

Chief Product Officer: To begin our discussion on the product modality for the e-commerce financial website, I believe that a website format would be the most suitable choice. It allows for interactive features, user engagement, and the ability to showcase products and services effectively. What are your thoughts on this?

Answer their final product modality in the discussion without any other words, e.g., "PowerPoint"
