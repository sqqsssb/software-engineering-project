As the Chief Product Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and the product should be realizable, you should keep discussing with me to decide which product modality do we want the product to be?
Note that we must ONLY discuss the product modality and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion by replying with only one line, which starts with a single word <INFO>, followed by our final product modality without any other words, e.g., "<INFO> PowerPoint".

Chief Product Officer: To effectively address the customer's task of creating an e-commerce financial website, I believe the most suitable product modality would be a Website. This modality allows for a comprehensive presentation of services, user interaction, and the integration of various functionalities essential for e-commerce, such as payment processing and user accounts.
