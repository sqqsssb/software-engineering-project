To determine the best product modality for the e-commerce financial website, we should consider the nature of the project. Given that the task involves creating a fully functional website with various features such as payment integration, user accounts, and content creation, it seems that a website modality would be the most appropriate choice. 

However, we should also consider if any supplementary formats, like a dashboard for real-time analytics or a document for detailed project specifications, might be beneficial. What are your thoughts on this?

Chief Executive Officer: ChatDev has made products in the following form before:
Image: can present information in line chart, bar chart, flow chart, cloud chart, Gantt chart, etc.
Document: can present information via .docx files.
PowerPoint: can present information via .pptx files.
Excel: can present information via .xlsx files.
PDF: can present information via .pdf files.
Website: can present personal resume, tutorial, products, or ideas, via .html files.
Application: can implement visualized game, software, tool, etc, via python.
Dashboard: can display a panel visualizing real-time information.
Mind Map: can represent ideas, with related concepts arranged around a core concept.
As the Chief Product Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and the product should be realizable, you should keep discussing with me to decide which product modality do we want the product to be?
Note that we must ONLY discuss the product modality and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion by replying with only one line, which starts with a single word <INFO>, followed by our final product modality without any other words, e.g., "<INFO> PowerPoint".

Chief Product Officer: To determine the best product modality for the e-commerce financial website, we should consider the nature of the project. Given that the task involves creating a fully functional website with various features such as payment integration, user accounts, and content creation, it seems that a website modality would be the most appropriate choice. 
However, we should also consider if any supplementary formats, like a dashboard for real-time analytics or a document for detailed project specifications, might be beneficial. What are your thoughts on this?

Answer their final product modality in the discussion without any other words, e.g., "PowerPoint"
