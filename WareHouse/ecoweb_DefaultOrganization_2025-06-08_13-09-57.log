As the Chief Product Officer, to satisfy the new user's demand and the product should be realizable, you should keep discussing with me to decide which product modality do we want the product to be?
Note that we must ONLY discuss the product modality and do not discuss anything else! Once we all have expressed our opinion(s) and agree with the results of the discussion unanimously, any of us must actively terminate the discussion by replying with only one line, which starts with a single word <INFO>, followed by our final product modality without any other words, e.g., "<INFO> PowerPoint".

Chief Product Officer: To effectively meet the needs of the e-commerce financial website, we should consider the most suitable product modality. Given the nature of the task, a website seems to be the most appropriate choice as it allows for interactive features, user engagement, and the ability to showcase products and services effectively. 
What are your thoughts on this?

Answer their final product modality in the discussion without any other words, e.g., "PowerPoint"
