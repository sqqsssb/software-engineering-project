To complete the task, I will give you one or more instructions, and you must help me to write a specific solution that appropriately solves the requested instruction based on your expertise and my needs.]

To determine the best product modality for the online shopping system, we should consider the nature of the system and how users will interact with it. 

1. **Website**: This seems to be the most suitable option as it allows for a user-friendly interface where customers can browse products, manage their shopping cart, and complete transactions. It can also be easily updated and maintained.

2. **Application**: While an application could provide a more robust experience, it may require more resources for development and distribution. It could be beneficial if we want to offer a mobile version of the shopping system.

3. **Dashboard**: This could be useful for internal analytics and monitoring of sales, but it doesn't directly serve the end-user experience for shopping.

Given these considerations, I believe a **Website** would be the most effective modality for the online shopping system. What are your thoughts?
