# Say Hi Application

A simple GUI application that greets users with a friendly "Hi!" message.

## Overview

The Say Hi Application is designed to provide a user-friendly interface that allows users to click a button and receive a greeting. This application utilizes the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI) that enhances user interaction.

- **User Interface**: The application features a simple layout with a label and a button, making it easy to use for all ages.

## Installation Instructions

To run the Say Hi Application, you need to have Python installed on your machine along with the Tkinter library. Tkinter is included with most Python installations, but if you encounter any issues, you may need to install it separately.

### Step 1: Install Python

If you haven't already installed Python, download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

### Step 2: Verify Tkinter Installation

To check if Tkinter is installed, you can run the following command in your Python environment:

```python
import tkinter
```

If no errors occur, Tkinter is installed correctly.

### Step 3: Run the Application

1. Download the `main.py` file containing the application code.
2. Open your terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located.
4. Run the application using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

## How to Use the Application

2. You will see a label that says "Press the button to say Hi!".
3. Click the "Say Hi" button.
4. A message box will pop up displaying the greeting "Hi".

## Conclusion

The Say Hi Application is a simple yet effective way to demonstrate the capabilities of Python and Tkinter for creating GUI applications. Feel free to modify the code to add more features or customize the greetings!
