# Say Hi App

A simple GUI application that displays a greeting message when a button is pressed.

## Introduction

The Say Hi App is a lightweight Python application that utilizes the Tkinter library to create a graphical user interface (GUI). The main function of the app is to display a message box with the greeting "Hi" when the user clicks the "Say Hi" button. This application is perfect for beginners looking to understand the basics of GUI programming in Python.

## Main Functions

- **Display GUI**: The application opens a window with a label and a button.
- **Say Hi**: When the button is clicked, a message box appears displaying the text "Hi".

## Installation

To run the Say Hi App, you need to have Python installed on your machine. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Install Tkinter**: Tkinter is included with most Python installations. You can check if it's available by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
   ```bash
   python -m tkinter
   ```
   If a small window appears, Tkinter is installed correctly.

3. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional)**: It's a good practice to create a virtual environment for your projects. You can do this using the following commands:
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `myenv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

4. **Install Dependencies**: If you need to add any additional packages in the future, you can create a `requirements.txt` file. For now, the application does not require any external dependencies beyond Python and Tkinter.

   Example of a `requirements.txt` file (if needed in the future):
   ```
   # Add any additional packages here
   ```

## How to Use the Say Hi App

1. **Run the Application**: Navigate to the directory where `main.py` is located and run the following command:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Interact with the GUI**: Once the application is running, you will see a window with a label and a button. Click the "Say Hi" button.

3. **View the Greeting**: A message box will pop up displaying the message "Hi".
